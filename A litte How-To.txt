A little how to on formating

Final touch formatting can be done once the flash card information is inputed/imported.

The easiest & fastest way to create flash cards is to use an editor like Geany to created text files.

Anki accepts text file imports in this format:

**********************************************
Question is what you can do for your country?;build a supercomputer
**********************************************

...so a single line of text seperating question and answer by a semi-colon and ended by a line-break/enter keystroke

To skip to a new line for your answers (or to skip a couple of lines and leave a space:

add<br>to<br>the line

or DNS<br><br>...stands for domain name resolution
(this skips to a new line, then skips to a new line again)

If you have any doubts, you can ask me in class of course, but the files included in Anki QA Files folder should give pretty good examples.

For one person to make anki cards for all the book would take a long, long time. For a group this could be done in a couple weeks maybe.

Best of luck to you all.
