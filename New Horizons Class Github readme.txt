The anki application is here or you can download it yourself from the source at:

https://apps.ankiweb.net/

The Anki program works through a complex algorithm to determine which facts you know well (based on self reported ease of recall) and which facts or ideas that you need more time with. This has been revealed as the single biggest factor in memory retention.

After you review some cards and are done memorizing them, Anki will start introducing new cards to your practice base. After a period of hours, days, weeks, or months, Anki can generate graphic metrics on your performance on certain decks.

Here I've made decks for things that we are (for the most part) studying in this multi-subject/certificate class at New Horizons. I was thinking of breaking it down into books & chapters of the books. 

For instance, I've been working on the A+ chapters as fast as I could, but I'll have to revisit them because I wasn't able to read and make questions for the entire chapters yet.

I think with all of us working together (or atleast some of us) we could make flashcards for all the books (A+, Net+, Sec+, Cloud+).

This would be a great way to smash through the exams other than calculation problems.

Look forward to working together with everyone!

-Jeremy
